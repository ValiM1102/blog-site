        <h1>The importance of SPF in your life:</h1>
        <p>The sun is the main enemy when it comes to the beauty of the skin, but also of health, because exposure to the sun without SPF leads to several problems as you will learn next.</p>
        <h2>What is SPF?</h2>
        <p>SPF or <em> Sun Protection Factor</em> <span style="margin-left: 4px;">is</span>  the way we can measure how much solar radiation or energy is required to produce sunburn on protected skin, as the SPF rating increases the same will do with the protection level.</p>
        <h3>Why is it important to wear SPF sunscreen?</h3>
        <p>Your skin is exposed everyday to the UV radiations produced by the sun and this will result in premature aging, wrinkles, pigment spots, melasma and skin cancer.</p>
        <h3>How often will sun exposure produce skin cancer?</h3>
        <p>In USA 90% of the skin cancer cases are caused by the sun so SPF rated sunscreen is very important to prevent this.</p>
        <h3>Do I need to apply SPF sunscreen only when it's sunny outside?</h3>
        <p>No, you need to apply your SPF sunscreen everyday, because even when it's cloudy outside, around 80% of the UV rays are still present.</p>
        <h2>Which UV rays are more dangerous?</h2>
        <p>There are 2 types of UV rays, UVA and UVB.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>UVA Rays</h3> 
                <p>UVA rays hit the earth more then UVB rays do and they are associated with long-term problems: wrinkles, aging, skin cancer.</p>
                <p>They are not absorbed by ozone or water, so they penetrate deeper into the skin, up to the collagen and elastin fibers.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>UVB Rays</h3>
                <p>UVB rays stimulate the production of melanin and lead to sunburns, increasing the risk of cancer, they do not penetrate as deeply as UVA rays</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Do I need to use SPF indoors?</h3>
        <p>Yes because UVA rays penetrate through windows so you are not really protected indoors.</p>
        <h3>Are there more types of SPF?</h3>
        <p>There are 2 types of SPF, they either use physical filters or they use chemical filters</p>
